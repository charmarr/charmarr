summary: Test utility charm for validating Charmarr interface implementations
description: |
  A minimal test utility charm that implements the requirer side of all Charmarr
  interfaces. Used for integration testing of provider charms.

  This charm:
  - Implements all Charmarr interfaces as requirer only
  - Publishes minimal data to complete relation handshakes
  - Receives provider data for test assertions
  - Has no config options - uses sensible defaults

  Tests use juju show-unit or jhack to inspect received relation data.
